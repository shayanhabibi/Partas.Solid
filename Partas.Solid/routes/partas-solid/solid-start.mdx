# Solid/Start

Lite bindings to the SolidStart library.

:::warning
These bindings do not wrap all available components/functions
:::

:::note
Should Fable eventually support conditional extension compilation, then
these bindings will be completed, as it will mean we could have 0 reliance
on having js config files
:::

:::important
Ensure your dependencies include `@solidjs/start`.

Ensure you open the `Partas.Solid.Start` namespace.

## Functions

### useServer

Emits `"use server";` in the output.

```fsharp tab title="F#"
useServer()
```

```jsx tab title="JSX"
"use server";
```

### getServerFunctionMeta

Used within a server-side function to retrieve the server metadata.

Returns the `id` value from the returned object directly.

### defineConfig

Either takes an object or a list of key,value pairs.

Not much use since its used within a context that requires a specific name/extension.

### mount

Not much use since its used within a context where the `.fs.jsx` would be invalid.

Used within the `entry-client.fsx` file:

```fsharp
Client.mount((fun () -> StartClient()), document.getElementById "app")
```

### clientOnly

Use with a lambda that dynamically imports the component/element to ensure it
is only rendered on the client side.

```fsharp title="Signature"
type Exports with
    [<ImportMember(Spec.path)>]
    static member clientOnly (importFunc: unit -> JS.Promise<HtmlElement>): TagValue = jsNative
```

## Components
