# Types

Contains DUs, types, and functions relating to those types.

:::note
The plugin is extensively documented in the source code to explain usage.

For this reason, only sparse notes are included here.
:::

Many patterns relate to abstracting away recursive drilling of a node
which may be a wrapper such as a typecast, to elucidate a type or identity
within.

Unions are used as the result of these patterns, such that the consumption
for higher order patterns is simplified.

Examples of these are the union types `MemberRefType` and `IdentType`. The
primary purpose of the latter, is to remove the purposely derranged identifiers
that we match against from consuming patterns, such as `PARTAS_YIELD`.

## `ElementBuilder`

This record is the end objective for tag transformations.

Collecting and constructing this record, can then be processed uniformly into
a `JSX.create` call.

## `PluginContext`

This record is threaded all transformations.

It provides the cache arrays for collecting getters and setters, and exposes
the component flags to transformations to conditionally alter behaviour.

It also exposes the plugin helper to all transformations, allowing warnings and
errors to be passed to the Fable compiler.

It will be commonly seen as the first argument to many patterns and functions.
