# Spec

Contains methods to render or modify specific AST nodes under the `Baked` module.

Contains helper patterns or utilities to recognize and filter different AST Nodes under their respective module names.

These are things such as the PartasName active pattern in the Ident module, which will only match against declared types that start with `Partas.Solid`, and then sanitize the type name and provide it as the matched value.
