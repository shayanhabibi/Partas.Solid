# Utilities

Contains utilities that are frequently used to simplify pattern recognition such as:

```fsharp
let (|StartsWith|_|) (value: string) = function
    | (s: string) when s.StartsWith(value) -> Some()
    | _ -> None
```

These utilities should be based on primitives rather than structures defined in `Types.fs`.

The only reason it is compiled after `Types.fs` is to allow us to utilise `PluginContext` (which is defined in `Types.fs`) if required.
