title: Attribute Flags
---

# {frontmatter.title}

Enums accessible by the `ComponentFlag` qualifier.

Eg: `ComponentFlag.Default`

Are usable in both `SolidComponentAttribute` and `SolidTypeComponentAttribute`.

:::details[Default]
Default transformations.
:::

:::details[DebugMode]
Prints the AST tree before transformation.

Use this when submitting issues.
:::

:::details[SkipPojoOptimisation]
SolidComponents optimise Pojo constructors so that setter members which are not
within the primary constructor are compiled into the object initialiser instead
of being deferred.
:::

:::details[PrintDisposals]
!NOISY!

Prints any expressions that are disposed of in transformation.
:::

:::details[SkipCEOptimisation]
SolidComponents optimise out computation expressions, particularly of lists
etc.

This will be handled primarily by the Fable transpiler in Fable 5.
