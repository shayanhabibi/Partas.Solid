title: Table Component
---

# {frontmatter.title}

Next up, we'll want to create our style base table components.

Create a `Table.fs` file to store these components in the `Partas.Solid.Example` namespace.

These components are just going to be opinionated, styled, but extensible bases for
our data tables.

```fsharp title="Table.fs"
namespace Partas.Solid.Example

open Partas.Solid
open Fable.Core
```

We'll want to create styled versions of `table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tfoot`, `tr`, `th`, `td` and `caption`.

You can change the styles, or make your own versions.

First we'll make the `TableCaption` as an example.

```fsharp title="Table.fs"
[<Erase>]
type TableCaption() =
    inherit caption()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.__ =
        caption(class' = Lib.cn [|
                "mt-4 text-sm text-muted-foreground"
                props.class'
            |]).spread props
```

First, we are inheriting all attributes of the native `caption` element, and we use
that as the returned element.

We're using the utility we made before `Lib.cn` to merge and overwrite any of our
preset classes with any classes that are passed to the component.

We then spread any other attributes into the object.

> Try your hand at the next component on your own

The next component we'll make is the `Table` component, which will inherit from `table`.

The `Table` component will be a `div` with the classes `"relative w-full overflow-auto"`
wrapping a `table` component that will have the classes `"w-full caption-bottom text-sm"`
along with any classes that are passed to the `Table` component. The `table` component
should also receive all other attributes that might have been passed to `Table`.

:::details[Table Component]
```fsharp title="Table.fs"
[<Erase>]
type Table() =
    inherit table()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.__ =
        div(class' = "relative w-full overflow-auto") {
            table(class' = Lib.cn [|
                    "w-full caption-bottom text-sm"
                    props.class'
                |]).spread props
        }
```

We then complete the component set with the following:

```fsharp title="Table.fs"
[<Erase>]
type TableHeader() =
    inherit thead()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.constructor =
        thead(class' = Lib.cn [| "[&_tr]:border-b"
                                 props.class' |])
            .spread props

[<Erase>]
type TableBody() =
    inherit tbody()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.constructor =
        tbody(class' = Lib.cn [|
            "[&_tr:last-child]:border-0"
            props.class'
        |]).spread props

[<Erase>]
type TableFooter() =
    inherit tfoot()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.constructor =
        tfoot(class' = Lib.cn [|
            "bg-primary font-medium text-primary-foreground"
            props.class'
        |]).spread props

[<Erase>]
type TableRow() =
    inherit tr()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.constructor =
        tr(
            class' = Lib.cn [|
                "border-b transition-colors hover:bg-muted/50 data-[state=selected]:bg-muted"
                props.class'
            |]
        ).spread props

[<Erase>]
type TableHead() =
    inherit th()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.constructor =
        th(
            class' = Lib.cn [|
                "h-10 px-2 text-left align-middle font-medium
                text-muted-foreground [&:has([role=checkbox])]:pr-0"
                props.class'
            |]
        ).spread props

[<Erase>]
type TableCell() =
    inherit td()
    [<SolidTypeComponentAttribute>]
    member props.constructor =
        td(class' = Lib.cn [| "p-2 align-middle [&:has([role=checkbox])]:pr-0"; props.class' |]).spread props
```
