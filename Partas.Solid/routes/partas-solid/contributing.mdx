# Contributing

All contributions, from usage, issues, discussions, documentation, features, etc are appreciated!

## Docs

I'm too close to this project now to understand what needs to be explained further. I would appreciate a helping hand in crafting documentation pages or letting me know where you need help.

## Standard Library

All submissions are appreciated. If a submission is made, it will very likely be relevant to, and useful for `Oxpecker.Solid` also.

Contributors will be provided opportunity to contribute to `Oxpecker.Solid` themselves, otherwise it will be done by myself and credited to them.
