## Passing Components as Values

A `SolidTypeComponent` or `SolidComponent`[^1] can be passed as a value by wrapping it in the TagValue object. They can then be rendered into a tag by calling render.

[^1]: As of version `1.2.0`

```fsharp
let Comp = TagValue(MyComponent)
Comp.render()
```

### Operator Overloads

You can also use the `!@` and `%` Operator overloads to perform the above actions.

```fsharp
let Comp = !@MyComponent
// a tagvalue can render the property set of an anonymous record
Comp % {| ``class`` = "class" |}
// a tagvalue can render the property set of any element
Comp % div(class' = "class")
```
