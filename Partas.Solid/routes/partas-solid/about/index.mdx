# Introduction

`Partas.Solid` is a plugin for the F# to JS transpiler `Fable`.


Partas.Solid differs from other front end plugins in F# in its overarching goal:

:::important[]
To define a DSL that allows building HTML/JSX trees for native, imported, **and** user defined components
:::

## What this means

* You can **_define_** a component and use it **_within the same DSL_**

This means User defined components are ***indistinguishable*** from native or library imported components in their usage.
Forming DOM trees is consistently uniform in syntax, making it easier to read, understand, refactor, and use.

* When creating a UI element, you can inherit the ability to receive children or not, have classes, have event signatures,
all by interfacing a single type. No need to overload. No need to define optional signatures. Just go.
* Creating components with optional properties/attributes are as intuitive as the source material.

These are unique goals for Partas.Solid.

:::details[Isn't this Oxpecker.Solid?]
Partas.Solid is an opinionated fork of Lanayx's [Oxpecker.Solid](https://github.com/lanayx/oxpecker), the plugin aggressively transforms
the Fable AST to produce Solid-js compatible **JSX** with lots of syntactic sugar sprinkled in for a smooth developer experience.

There are fundamental differences with the goals of each plugin, which is why the fork exists. Where possible, everything is done to
simultaneously support and contribute to [Oxpecker.Solid](https://github.com/lanayx/oxpecker).
