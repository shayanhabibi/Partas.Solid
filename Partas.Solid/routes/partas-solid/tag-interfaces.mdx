# {frontmatter.title}

The following interfaces are exposed by the Partas.Solid library to provide
inheritance for common component structures and properties.

Beyond this, feel free to inherit from any of the concrete classes such as `div`.

## Foundation Interfaces

### `HtmlElement`

Base type for all elements.

To allow a class/type to be accepted as a child node in the computation expressions,
the type must derive from `HtmlElement`, or one of it's subsequent derivatives.

### `HtmlTag`

Implementation of `HtmlElement` with common/global solid-js attributes.

Interface provides the [support for extension methods](/partas-solid/extension-methods).

### `HtmlContainer`

Interface enables the computation expression to construct child elements.

## Derivative Interfaces

### `RegularNode`

An interface which provides common/global solid-js attributes, extension methods,
and accepts children nodes.

> This is essentially just a convenient interface to both HtmlContainer and HtmlTag

### `VoidNode`

An interface which provides common/global solid-js attributes, extension methods,
but does not accept any children nodes.

> This is essentially just an alias to HtmlTag.
>
> Historically, the Derivative Interfaces were concrete classes. The change
> to interfaces make this more-or-less redundant.

### `FragmentNode`

Special interface which renders `<> </>` in the plugin.

At face value, it is just a derivative of `HtmlContainer`. It is implemented
by the concrete class `Fragment()`.

## Special Interfaces

### `ChildLambdaProvider`

Provides interfaces which implement the lambda constructor functionality that is
already existing in components such as `For` and `Index`.

A numeric suffix to the interface name provides more explicit type parameter
numbers.

The plugin uncurries the lambda function that is passed as a child to the element.

### `ChildLambdaProviderStrict`

An implementation of the `ChildLambdaProvider` family of interfaces, with the
addendum that you can specify the exact type that the child must be.

An example use is for elements like the solidjs/router `Router`, which can only
accept children of type `Route`.

### `Polymorph`

Library support for polymorphic elements from `Kobalte` and `ArkUI`.

Usage is best described in the [Partas.Solid.Kobalte](/ecosystem/kobalte) binding
library documentation.
