# Clipboard

Designed to make reading and writing to the MDN `clipboard` API easy.

## ClipboardItem

```fsharp
type ClipboardItem = interface
```

A interface to the MDN `clipboard` API `ClipboardItem` interface.

[See `newClipboardItem` for creating a new `ClipboardItem`.](#newclipboarditem)

```fsharp
member presentationStyle: PresentationStyle with get
```

[See `PresentationStyle`.](#presentationstyle)

```fsharp
member types: string[] with get
```

```fsharp
member getType(``type``: string): JS.Promise<obj>
```

The `getType` method retrieves the data of a specific MIME type from the `ClipboardItem`. It returns a promise that resolves to the data object.
Errors if the MIME type is not found.

### PresentationStyle

```fsharp
type PresentationStyle = StringEnum
```

```fsharp
| Attachment
```

```fsharp
| Inline
```

```fsharp
| Unspecified
```

## newClipboardItem

```fsharp
let newClipboardItem(``type``: string, data: obj): ClipboardItem
```

`newClipboardItem` is a wrapper method around creating new `ClipboardItem` objects. It takes a MIME type and data object, 
[returning a new `ClipboardItem`.](#clipboarditem)

## readClipboard

```fsharp
let readClipboard(): JS.Promise<ClipboardItem[]>
```

Async read from the clipboard, returning a promise that resolves to an [array of `ClipboardItem`.](#clipboarditem)

## writeClipboard

```fsharp
let writeClipboard(input: string): unit
```

```fsharp
let writeClipboard(input: ClipboardItem[]): unit
```

Writes to the clipboard.

[See newClipboardItem for creating a new `ClipboardItem`.](#newclipboarditem)

:::note
The writing method is asynchronous, use the apostraphised version of the method to interact with the returned `Promise`.
:::

```fsharp
let writeClipboard'(input: string): JS.Promise<unit>
```

```fsharp
let writeClipboard'(input: ClipboardItem[]): JS.Promise<unit>
```

Writes to the clipboard asynchronously.

## createClipboard

The result of the `createClipboard` function can either be destructured with F# features using the apostraphe version
or used with named access via [the `ClipboardResult` interface.](#clipboardresult)

```fsharp
let createClipboard(
    ?data: Accessor<string | ClipboardItem[]>,
    ?deferInitial: bool
    ): ClipboardResult
```

:::note[Apostraphised Version]
```fsharp
let createClipboard'(
    ?data: Accessor<string | ClipboardItem[]>,
    ?deferInitial: bool
    ): 
    SolidResource<CliboardItem[]> * 
    (unit -> unit) * 
    (string -> JS.Promise<unit>)
```
:::

Provides full facilities for reading and writing to the clipboard.

Can write to the clipboard using either the returned `write` method of the `ClipboardResult`, or
through the input signal. It wraps the `clipboard` async API with a Solid resource to make pulling
from the clipboard easy. 

### ClipboardResult

```fsharp
type ClipboardResult = interface
```

A [result type for the `createClipboard` function](#createclipboard), which provides named access to the returned array values.

```fsharp
member resourceItems: SolidResource<ClipboardItem[]>
```

```fsharp
member refetch: (unit -> unit)
```

```fsharp
member write: (string -> JS.Promise<unit>)
```
