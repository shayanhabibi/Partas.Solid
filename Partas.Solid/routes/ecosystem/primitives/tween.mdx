# Tween

## Easing

```fsharp
type Easing = float -> float
```

## createTween

```fsharp
let createTween(
    target: Accessor<'T>,
    ?duration: int,
    ?easing: Easing
    ): Accessor<'T>
```

Creates an efficient tweening derived signal that smoothly transitions a given signal from its previous value to its
next value whenever it changes.

The target can be any reactive value (signal, memo, or function that calls such). For example, to use a component
prop, specify `fun () -> props.value`.

|Param|Desc|
|---|---|
|`target`||
|`duration`|Number of milliseconds to perform the transition from the previous value to the next. Defaults to 100.|
|`easing`|Easing is a function that maps a number between `1.` and `0.` to speed up or slow down different parts of
the transition. The default easing function is `linear`.|

Under the hood, `createTween` uses `requestAnimationFrame` to smoothly update the tweened value at the display refresh
rate.

After the tweened value reaches the underlying signal, it will stop updating via `requestAnimationFrame` for efficiency.
