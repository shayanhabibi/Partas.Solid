# Event Bus

## createEventBus

```fsharp
let createEventBus<'T>(): EventBus<'T>
```

[See `EventBus`](#eventbus)

## createEmitter

```fsharp
let createEmitter<'T>(): Emitter<'T>
```

[See `Emitter`](#emitter)

## createMappedEmitter

```fsharp
let createMappedEmitter<'MessageSchema>(): MappedEmitter<'MessageSchema>
```

[See `MappedEmitter` which is a F# friendly binding.](#mappedemitter)

## createEventHub

```fsharp
let createEventHub<'T> (?channels: 'T): EventHub<'T>
```

[See `EventHub`](#eventhub)

## EventBus

[See `createEventBus`](#createeventbus).

```fsharp
type EventBus<'T> = interface
```

Provides all base functions of an event-emitter, plus additional functions for managing listeners.

Its behavior could be customized with a config object. Good for advanced usage.

```fsharp
member listen: ('T -> unit) -> DisposeCallback
```

The disposal will be called automatically on cleanup. Use the callback to cleanup the resource earlier if required.

```fsharp
member emit: 'T -> unit
```

```fsharp
member clear: unit -> unit
```

## Emitter

[See `createEmitter`](#createemitter) and [see `createMappedEmitter`](#createmappedemitter) with the [F# friendly
version `MappedEmitter`](#mappedemitter)

```fsharp
type Emitter<'MessageTyper> = interface
```

An emitter which you can listen to and emit various events.

```fsharp
member on: (string * (obj -> unit)) -> DisposeCallback
```

The sub is cleaned up automatically on dismount, but you can cleanup the resource earlier if required.

```fsharp
member emit: (string * obj) -> unit
```

```fsharp
member clear: unit -> unit
```

## MappedEmitter

[See `createMappedEmitter`](#createmappedemitter)

```fsharp
type MappedEmitter<'MessageMapper> = interface
```

This is a typesafe version of the `Emitter` made for F#/Fable.

It uses the path from the type to its member as the key of the emission. Because we provide a typed path,
we get the benefit of having the member being typed as the message type.

```fsharp
member on
    (mapping: 'MessageMapper -> 'MessageType)
    (callback: 'MessageType -> unit)
    : DisposeCallback
```

```fsharp
member emit
    (mapping: 'MessageMapper -> 'MessageType)
    (message: 'MessageType)
    : unit
```

```fsharp
member clear: unit -> unit
```

## GlobalEmitter

```fsharp
type GlobalEmitter<'T> = inherit Emitter<'T>
```

A wrapper around `createEmitter`. Creates an emitter with which you can listen to and emit various events.
With this emitter you can also listen to all events.

```fsharp
member listen (obj -> unit): DisposeCallback
```

## EventHub

[See `createEventHub`](#createventhub)

```fsharp
type EventHub<'T> = inherit GlobalEmitter<'T.
```

Provides helpers for using a group of event buses. Can be used with `createEventBus`, `createEventStack` or any emitter
with the same api.

:::warning
Not much more has been bound for this type. I think I was intending to build a type provider for this. Which is a lot
of effort for not much worth (to me right now).
