# Solid Primitives

The following bindings are for the community provided `@solid-primitives`.

Signatures will be provided for the bound functions/methods.

Usage is best discerned from the source material.

## Femto

All primitives are compatible with Femto to install.

```ansi
femto install Partas.Solid.Primitives.Mouse
```

## Use, Make and Create

As per the solid-primitives naming scheme, primitives that are labeled with
the `make` prefix are non-reactive, but will clean-up their resources on disposal.

Primitives marked with the `use` prefix, are typically *rootless* primitives.

> This means that there would typically be only one of that primitive, which is shared
> between all consumers.

Primitives marked with `create` prefix, are *reactive* and will clean-up resources
on disposal.

## Disposal Callbacks

Some primitives will provide a `DisposeCallback` which is a void function `unit -> unit` used to cleanup
the resource.
