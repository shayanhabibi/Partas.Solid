# Devices

Creates a primitive to get a list of media devices, with filtered versions for convenience.

## createDevices

```fsharp
let createDevices(): Accessor<MediaDeviceInfo[]>
```

Creates a list of all media devices.

## createMicrophones

```fsharp
let createMicrophones(): Accessor<MediaDeviceInfo[]>
```

Creates a list of all media devices that are microphones.

## createSpeakers

```fsharp
let createSpeakers(): Accessor<MediaDeviceInfo[]>
```

Creates a list of all media devices that are speakers.

## createCameras

```fsharp
let createCameras(): Accessor<MediaDeviceInfo[]>
```

Creates a list of all media devices that are cameras.

## createAccelerometer

```fsharp
let createAccelerometer(
    ?includeGravity: bool,
    ?interval: float
    ): Accessor<DeviceAcceleration option>
```

|Param|Desc|
|---|---|
|`?includeGravity`|`bool`, default is `false`|
|`?interval`|Numer as ms, default value is `100`|

Creates a reactive wrapper to get device acceleration.

## createGyroscope

```fsharp
let createGyroscope(
    ?interval: float
    ): Accessor<GyroscopeValue>
```

|Param|Desc|
|---|---|
|`?interval`|Number as ms. Default value is `100`|

### GyroscopeValue

```fsharp
type GyroscopeValue = interface
```

```fsharp
member alpha: float
```

```fsharp
member beta: float
```

```fsharp
member gamma: float
```
