# Idle

## createIdleTimer

```fsharp
let createIdleTimer(
    ?idleTimeout: int,
    ?promptTimeout: int,
    ?onIdle: Event -> unit,
    ?onPrompt: Event -> unit,
    ?onActive: Event -> unit,
    ?startManually: bool,
    ?events: Event[],
    ?element: HtmlElement
    ): IdleTimer
```

Provides different accessors and methods to observe the user's idle status and react to its changing.

## IdleTimer

```fsharp
type IdleTimer = interface
```

```fsharp
member isIdle: Accessor<bool>
```

Report user status.

```fsharp
member isPrompted: Accessor<bool>
```

Report user status.

```fsharp
member start: unit -> unit
```

Start the timer.

```fsharp
member stop: unit -> unit
```

Stop the timer.

```fsharp
let reset: unit -> unit
```

Reset the timer.

```fsharp
let triggerIdle: unit -> unit
```

Manually sets `isIdle` to true and triggers `onIdle` callback (with custom manualidle event).
