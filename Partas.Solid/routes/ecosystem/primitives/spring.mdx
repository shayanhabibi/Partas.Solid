# Spring

Also provides an extension for `float` setters.

```fsharp
open Partas.Solid.Primitives.Spring.SetterExtensions
```

```fsharp
[<Extension>]
static member inline Invoke(
    setter: Setter<float>,
    newValue: float,
    options: StringSetterOptions
    ): ???
```

:::warning
The above binding seems janky and needs to be reviewed

## createSpring

```fsharp
let createSpring(
    inialValue: 'T when 'T :> (float | float seq | Accessor<float>),
    ?stiffness: float,
    ?damping: float
    ): Signal<'T>
```

|Param|Desc|
|---|---|
|`initialValue`|The initial value of the signal.|
|`stiffness`|Options to configure the physics of the spring.|
|`damping`|Options to configure the physics of the spring.|

Creates a `Signal<float>` that uses spring physics when interpolating from one value to another.

This means when the value changes, instead of transitioning at a steady rate, it *'bounces'* like a spring would,
depending on the physics parameters provided. This adds a level of realism to the transitions and can enhance
the user experience.

Works best for basic data types that can be interpolated, such as `number` types, `Date`, and `Array`s.

## createDerivedSpring

```fsharp
let createDerivedSpring(
    target: Accessor<'T when 'T :> (float | float seq)>,
    ?stiffness: float,
    ?damping: float
    ): Accessor<'T>
```

Creates a spring that interpolates based on changes to the passed signal.

Works similar to [`@solid-primitives/tween`](/ecosystem/primitives/tween).
